This is Hearing Pairs! (tentative name). 

It is supposed to be a memory matching game that tests your memory and sense of sound by 
matching images and sounds. There are eight pairs all together. 

The game is really simple. You just match up cards that share the same icons. When they 
match they turn green and if there is an error they turn red and return to their original 
state. The main task of matching cards can be completed but there is no audio. The 
interface is pretty bare for the moment. There is also supposed to be an area for the user
to enter name too but that had been left out. 
 
THE TASK! 

Its quite simple. Find and click on the decks of cards and locate all eight pairs. You 
get a surprise message at the end. Watch how it tracks the moves you make. 


UPDATE 04/30

The task remains the same - to find and match all the card pairs but there is still a problem with getting the audio to work.  

The Audio is not working still. Having trouble finding a solution to this problem. I've included proof of concept for the project though. You can find it within the app.js code that calls the functions to play the audio as while as the html code within each card of the deck.
